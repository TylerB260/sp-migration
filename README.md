# sp-migration

A PowerShell tool I wrote for migrating on-premise SharePoint 2013/2016 sites to SharePoint Online sites. 
Supports most types of file libraries. Files retain their version history and custom columns.

I do not intend on supporting this tool - use it at your own risk. If this blows up your stuff, it's on you.
